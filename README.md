# PrestaShop plugin
Our connector plugins trigger a push-a-button connection and thus eliminate the inconvenience of sharing logins, passwords, and all kinds of keys.

PrestaShop Plugin Installation

1) Go to the PrestaShop admin panel. 2) Find the Modules and Services tab and choose Modules and Services in the dropdown list. 3) Click on Add a new module. 4) Press the Choose a file button. Find the connector archive and click on Upload this module. 5) Find the connector in the list of installed modules and press the Configure button.

Service enhancement takes research, data collection, and analysis. That is why we added a snipped of tracking code into our plugins. It gets activated after the connector has been installed. It does not track any personal data and serves as a statistics means only.
