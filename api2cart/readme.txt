How to install target bridge:

1. Upload "bridge2cart" folder from this archive to your store root directory

2. Set the permissions as following:

   "bridge.php" - 644 or 666, depending on your server configuration;
   "/bridge2cart" folder - 755 or 777, depending on your server configuration.

To check if the Bridge files are working correctly, enter address line: http://[yourstore url]/bridge2cart/bridge.php in your browser.
If you see �ERROR_BRIDGE_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED� the bridge is working CORRECTLY.
If not, please update permissions for items mentioned above once again.

NOTE!
We strongly recommend to turn off redirect on your site for proper work of the Connection Bridge files.
To check if you need to turn off redirect, follow this link "http://[yourstore url]/bridge2cart/bridge.php" and once it's
redirecting to some other link you should disable redirects in your .htaccess file.
It's a hidden file residing in your "shop" folder.
